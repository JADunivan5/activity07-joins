Activity 7 - Joins!
================

It is assumed that you have read Chapter 13 from R4DS and completed the
Join Data Sets Primer.

In this activity, you will:

-   Combine datasets that have similar structure using `bind_*`.
-   Join datasets that may have different structures using `*_join`.
-   Create new variables that are conditioned on another variable using
    `case_when`.
-   Visualize spatial data.

## ☑️ Task 1: The Workflow

Remember that more detailed directions can be found in [Task 1 of
Activity
4](https://github.com/gvsu-sta518/activity04-data-pipelines#%EF%B8%8F-task-1-the-workflow).

![fork](README-img/fork-icon.png) **Fork** this repo and clone it to a
new [RStudio Project](https://rstudio.gvsu.edu/)

<b>Planned Pause Point</b>: If you have any questions, contact your
instructor or another group.

## ☑️ Task 2: Complete the RMarkdown File

The `activity07-joins.Rmd` file contains the directions for this
activity. For the rest of this class period, you will complete the
RMarkdown document with your neighbor(s). Your instructor will be
circling and be available to help when needed.

Note that each person is working in their own repo. We are not worrying
about collaborating for the time being and instead will be working on
being more comfortable with the workflow for working between RStudio and
GitHub.

However, do not continue in this README document until you and your
neighbor(s) have completed your `.Rmd` files.

## ☑️ Task 3: Reflection

Take 5 minutes and pick one or two things that are still unclear. What
do you need to do to better understand these items?

**Next**: Activity 8 will explore three special variable types: strings,
factors, and datetimes.
